# Kaggle Breast cancer Challenge

<p>I recently participated in a Kaggle challenge focused on breast cancer diagnosis. This hands-on project involved extensive use of Python libraries, such as Pandas and NumPy, for data analysis. To address class imbalance, I employed the imbalanced-learn library, specifically using SMOTE for oversampling.

After conducting exploratory data analysis and data visualization using Seaborn, I experimented with a range of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting. The highlight of the project was achieving an impressive 96.49% accuracy using the Random Forest algorithm. I further optimized the model through hyperparameter tuning with grid search.

During the project, I encountered challenges related to deprecated parameters in scikit-learn and overcame them successfully. Additionally, I emphasized collaboration with medical experts to ensure the clinical relevance of the model, aligning it with practical medical diagnosis applications. This Kaggle challenge experience showcases my data science skills in a real-world context and highlights that I tried and evaluated multiple models for this task, with Random Forest emerging as the top-performing model. It's a strong asset in interviews for Data Science positions.
